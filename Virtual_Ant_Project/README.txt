This is the final project for ESE124 by Joseph Cabrera.
There are five files, the first is the main code (SSJCJAFinal_Project.c) which executes 
instructions and displays the results of the instructions. The main code also displays a 
local maze to show marked areas, as well as the starting maze. The second file is the ant 
instructions (Ant_Instructions.txt), or it's intelligence, and the third is the maze layout 
(maze.txt). These are both inputs for the code. The fourth file is the outputted movements
of the ant (Ant_Movements_Out.txt), and the fifth is this readme.
